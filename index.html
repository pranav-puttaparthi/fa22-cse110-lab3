                    <h2>Understanding The Prompt As A Group:</h2>
                    <p>We took turns reading the prompt line by line, and broke down what each section was trying to convey.
                        We even drew a little diagram of it, which can be seen below:

                    <h2>Brainstorming Possible Project Ideas:</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so although we were supposed to spend a lot more time doing this, we admittedly got a little
                        sidetracked. Something else in particular, something kitchen-related, caught our attention and
                        we ended up losing track of time. We'll make sure to be a lot more focused with this in the next meeting.

                        <p>We got <i>distracted</i> because Marvin found some popsicles in the fridge as he was coming back
                            from a bathroom break. The stash itself was <b>massive</b>, and it had all different sorts of flavors.
                            I feel bad for the people who missed out on raiding it, because it was an absolutely glorious time.
